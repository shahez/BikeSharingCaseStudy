## General Information
This assignment focuses on modeling the demand for shared bikes with available independent variables. It aims to assist management in understanding how demand varies with different features, allowing them to adjust business strategy accordingly. The dataset includes variables like 'weathersit' and 'season' with numeric values, and careful data preparation is necessary for accurate model building.

## Conclusions
The model building process and evaluation using the R-squared score provide valuable insights into predicting bike demand. Business goals can be aligned with demand dynamics, contributing to better decision-making.
